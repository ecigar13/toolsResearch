# Hbase

### What is it?
A fast response NoSQL database. Part of Hadoop eco system, but faster. A column-orient NoSQL database.

### Pros
- Supports real time processing and OLTP because of its speed
- Much faster than HDFS
- Handles large amount of data

### Cons
- Must use Zookeeper
- Does not support SQL
- Still based on Hadoop, so best suited for batch job


### Compared to similar tools
Similar to Cassandra, but not for high-throughput, write-intensive applications.
