# Apache Mesos  

### What is it?
Cluster infrastructure management, but also handles non-containerized processes.

### Pros
- Also deals with non-containerized processes in addition to Docker
- Has a UI for management

### Cons
- Needs Zookeeper
- Doesn't provide secured cluster
- Lack of development. Kubernetes is the future

### Compared to similar tools
More matured solution than Kubernetes, but lack of development, so it's considered dead.
