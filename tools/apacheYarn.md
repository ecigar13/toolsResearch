# Apache YARN

### What is it?
Yet Another Resource Negotiator for Hadoop 2.0. Provides an API layer to interact with Hadoop.

### Pros
- Allows you to work with API instead of with Hadoop directly
- Manages the resource to run MapReduce job. (Resource Negotiator)

### Cons


### Compared to similar tools
YARN is not an independent tool, it's an upgrade from Hadoop 1.0 to 2.0. It also doesn't manage entire cluster/infrastructure like Kubernetes of Mesos.
