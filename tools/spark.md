# Apache Spark

### What is it?
Big Data tool for pulling and analyzing data from multiple sources. Uses memory instead of hard disk.

### Pros
- At least 10x faster than Hadoop, so it's useful for more usecases than Hadoop
- Faster feedback
- Can pull data from multiple sources, instead of only HDFS (any DB type, S3, HDFS, stream...)
- Runs in memory

### Cons
- High memory cost
- Hard to set up

### Compared to similar tools
A faster version of Hadoop, not as scalable but less time, more memory.
